# Data Science Learning Journey ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey to becoming a data scientist! This repository is a collection of resources, notes, and projects that I follow while learning data science from the [CampusX Data Science Mentor Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z5-O7-5AXk&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z). 

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!

## ðŸ”— YouTube Course

I am following the Data Science Mentor Program by [CampusX](https://www.campusx.in/), which covers everything from the basics of data science to advanced topics like machine learning. You can find the complete playlist here:
